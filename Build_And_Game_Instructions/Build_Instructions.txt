This game was made using Unity2019.3.11f1.

The build settings should already be in the project in a settings file. (I've seen something in GitHub commits)

In the case that this isn't the case I have supplied two screenshots of the build settings I might have slightly changed.
(The game is set to play in a 1280x720p Window)

-- Note: In case of issues

I have had some issues with the game causing unity to randomly freeze on start in the editor for no obvious reason. 
- Could probably be fixed by forcing Unity to run scripts in a certain order in the settings, but it hasn't been a big enough problem for me to warrant this action.
Hopefully it behaves for you.

This does not seem to happen after building the game. 
(Sometimes the first time after building, but just don't click anything and it should load, or worst case restart it once)
