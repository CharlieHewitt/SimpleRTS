Simple_RTS:

Goal:
The goal of the game is to defeat the AI opponent. There will be a combat round every 2-3 minutes (see clock in bottom left corner), for which you should prepare an army.

Winning:
The first player to reduce the opponents health to 0 by winning 3 of these rounds is the winner.

Controlling the game:
You interact with the game through 3 menus, which are accessible with the buttons in the bottom right corner of the screen

Building Menu (house icon):
This is the menu that will be open when the game first starts. Here you can select a building to construct on a certain build plot.
There is a limit of one building of each type. 
If you are trying to build a building and it is not letting you, make sure you have enough resources & have selected an empty building plot from the dropdown menu! 

Worker Menu (person icon):
You can reassign workers here to help optimise your resource gathering to construct the things you want faster!
Make sure to remove workers from a resource before adding them to another!

Note: After every combat round your supply cap and number of workers increases! So be sure to check back here often to see if you have any idle workers.
(There is a reminder message on the combat result screen)

Army Menu (sword icon):
You can view your current unit numbers & train new units here.
To train a unit you need to have the required resources, enough supply to create the unit and have it's prerequisite building constructed.
(Don't panic if you've built the building and can't make the units yet, it needs to finish building first! 

Note: As long as you have the required resources & supply you can queue up multiple units at once (only finished ones will participate in the upcoming combat round though)


-- Suggested plan for first try:

-> change workers to 9 on wood, 1 on magic stone
-> wait for resources to build blacksmiths (Building Menu)
-> Build blacksmiths
-> wait for completion
-> wait for resources/build 20 swordsmen (Army Menu)
-> wait for combat round 
-> see result, hopefully you've won

-> read the message reminding you to assign your 5 new workers to a resource!
-> assign workers 

-> plan for round 2

-> Lets try something a little bit different, decide on a second unit (Archer or Wizard)
-> look at the building cost / training cost
-> modify worker counts to help reach these resources
-> build building asap
-> build mixed army of units

-> Eventually you should have all the buildings built, and can build different army compositions or stick to the same ones until to game ends.


Happy gaming.
Hopefully your feedback will improve the game in the future!
